* A compact and easily distributable checklist webpage for online AP readers to place side-by-side with their DBQ window.
* This was created with only one specific DBQ in mind but it should be fairly easily adaptable to others.
* Tested with Chrome and Firefox on Windows 10.

HOWTO use:
1. Download the HTML file, or copy and paste it into a new text document
